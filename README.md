This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). This projects focuses on building a practise project for nepalese community event management in Australia. 

There are many events website which focuses on managing or creating events like meetup, but this website focuses only for Nepalese community in Australia. Due to Corona or Covid 19 impact the engagement within community has been widely reduced by atleast more than 80%. 

I see our community engagement collapsing. I hope this project helps our community.
